# Data Visualization and Why Everyone is Screaming About It: A Blog

In “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” Drucker makes an argument saying that when data is presented in a graph or chart it is actually capta, meaning that data can never be truly objective since the action of putting it into a graphical display format places a bias on the information. The use of graphs or other visualizations of data can be misleading since they are often seen as blissfully objective, full of truth and thus are hardly questioned. However, bar graphs and pie charts lie too, or more commonly omit what would hinder the author’s intention. Drucker states this as “the sheer power of the graphical display of ‘information visualization’ seems to have produced a momentary blindness among practitioners who would never tolerate such literal assumptions in textual work.” (Drucker) Drucker goes on to say that while data presented in a chart is “pure”, the author puts their bias into it simply by choosing which data to present, and how, whether it is intended or not. This can result in misleading information that is more dangerous than an opinion piece since, graphical display is commonly seen as unwavering facts. 

A way I have decided to examine this further is applying this critical thinking on the graphical information presented in the 2015 report “Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry” by the Entertainment Software Association. This is a document made up almost entirely of graphs and charts to show information on sales and demographic of gaming. Under the subheading “who is playing?” the report depicts a pie chart that states 46% of gamers are female and 54% are male. On the next page, “who is buying?” there is another chart that says 41% of game purchasers are female, and 59% are male. When put together that leaves 5% of girls that aren’t buying their own games; who is sponsoring and is there contact information? No where does the report ask where this missing 5% comes from, or why it could have come up in their research. This missing 5% is bothersome to few, but a big problem if one is looking to this report for this specific information on gender in the gaming community, because it provides a big question, and no answers.  

There is a good chance that a significant amount of the purchases recorded are parents buying games for their children, but there is no indication—not even in the section that comes later that discusses parents and their involvement in their children’s gaming— of how much of these purchases are parents, and if those “parent buyers” are included in one category or the other. This provides another issue since it is likely some games were bought on a joint account under both the mom and dad’s names, which would force the researcher to choose what to do with that stat. They would have to choose whether this purchase of a game was to be included under male purchaser, female purchaser, count for both, or not to be included at all. This is where the author’s bias would play a part, since now no matter how objective this information is, there is no way for the author to know who exactly used that joint account to buy Destiny for their 13-year-old unless they were in the store to witness it. 

This scenario, although seemingly a unique problem, realistically arose dozens of times when compiling the research for this graph. Let’s say then, that this unit of Destiny was bought using a credit card issued to Dan and Erin Milton. The researcher would hopefully be consistent and do with this scenario as they would with all others like it. They can choose to either: 
  a) put it under male purchaser since Dan was listed on the account first 
  b) count this purchase twice and put it under both categories 
  c) exclude this occurrence since there is no way for them to know exactly who did the buying or 
  d) make a judgment that depends on the individual researcher’s own bias and experience to pick a category for this purchase, thus     resulting in the facts relying on if the researcher thinks that Erin bought it because the mother does the shopping, or Dan bought it because he would know what to get. 

Decisions like this would have been personally made by someone at some point, the danger being they are not easily evident. Only when under critical examination does it change how the reader would understand the information. Moretti states in “Graphs, Maps, Trees” that “quantitative data are useful because they are independent of interpretation; [but] they are interesting because they demand an interpretation” (91). In the specific Destiny case presented above, that interpretation was made by some researcher who is overworked and underpaid at the ESA who had these numbers dumped in a pile on his desk hours ago with very little instruction and he’s too tired to care if there is a 2% misinformation in this 2015 yearly report of purchases based on gender. 

This problem is an extension of what Drucker is arguing; that traditional graphical displays that are so common in humanities does not have the capability to show these variables and conditions for information like this, which would eradicate the threat of invisible bias. In “Beyond Gutenberg: Transcending the Document Paradigm in Digital Humanities” Schloen confronts this very issue: “By organizing information within position-dependent data structures limited to one or two dimensions, such as strings and tables, we fail to represent the full range of scholarly observations and interpretations in a predictable and semantically rich digital form that permits powerful automated comparisons and analyses”. This article highlights the same issue that Digital Humanities now faces, as well as presents methods for rectifying it.  As Digital Humanities is evolving to be its own discipline, there needs to be an advancement in this area as we now have the capability, technology, and platforms to produce a modern graphical system that rights this issue. 

It is clear in the visualization below that this issue of graphical representation is not a small one, nor should it be ignored. Other articles on this topic are not hard to find at all, and in the three that I touch on here, you can see that through the extensive use of the word "data", the concern is prevelant.

If Digital Humanities is to carve itself a useful place in academia, I believe coming up with a solution to this problem os graphiical display is the best way to do that.
