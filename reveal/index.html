						<h2>What was Different About this One...</h2>
						<img src="https://tyjivory.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/vine2.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							Vine started as a new social media app striving to keep up with the flow of technology, utilizing the trend of photo-sharing in a quick and easily accessible format (much like Instagram), but evolved to videos as a natural, technological progression. Additionally, Vine's explore page functioned differently as well, which was very unique at the time. While most social-media sharing platforms showed users content in the explore page that were related to what they were already interested in, and catered to what kinds of accounts, hashtags and subject matter that user was already involved in, then sorted by popularity by default.  Vine took a different approach. It's explore function followed a different format, by using a sorting option when users posted content have an option to categorize such as "comedy", "loops", "animals", etc. and other users can choose to browse within those trending categories (or not trending) in most popular, or newer/rising. There aren't many social media applications that follow this model since Vine started it, which is unfortunate because it was a new and innovative way to share user created media that did not perpetuate the "standard" of popular that other apps do, like Twitter and Instagram.

						<h2>How It Evolved</h2>

							What started out as a social media app that utilizes 6 second looping videos, turned into something much greater than could have ever been anticipated. When it was first released not many people used it; it was new and users were still navigating what kind of virtual space that this new app would take up. After it took off, it  wasnâ€™t for video-sharing that mirrored photo-sharing like other social media apps. It quickly became what it will hereon be remembered as: a Meme Mill. In three years, Vine evolved from a shaking new sharing platform, to a creative outlet for users to spread short viral videos, and create their own jokes and skits that would easily circulate thanks to the unique explore function.

						<h2>How it Changed Everything</h2>
						<img src="https://www.funnyjunk.com/Memes+have+changed/funny-pictures/6099926#4a6ca0_6099482">
						<aside class="notes">
							Some see vine as a failure, having only been up for 3 years, but it has changed meme culture forever. More memes now are text with videos not images, because vine had provided that infrastructure to create humour in quick videos with captions telling half the story, thus needed the text in the memes, these are now all over Instagram. Instagram had introduced video sharing on top of its photo format in June 2013, 2 months after Vine had reached the top downloaded in the app store, presenting itself as a mean competitor, thus forcing them to evolve.

						<h2>This "Blight" in Pop-Culture will Confuse Future Academics</h2>
						<img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/703/419/42c.gif">
						<aside class="notes">
							In terms of media archeology, Vine will probably stump researchers years from now. During the 3 years that it ran, it went from social media, to new-content pusher, to viral video spreader, to a goldmine for memes and now, after its death, a martyr for internet culture. In content it pushed the evolution of memes (like any other cultural media) farther and faster than if it had never existed. In technology, it single-handedly shifted the norm of memes from static images and text, to short video loops with sound, and text as well. It made gifs more valuable in the long run, since vines are so short, making a gif out of them was easy, and thus made it easier to spread vines as that format instead of only using videos. Ignoring Vine as an important influencer in pop-culture is short-sighted.

						<h2> Vine's Legacy</h2>
						<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/67thbMluekU/maxresdefault.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							Vines live on in other forms. Some YouTube creators started their career on Vine such as TheGabbieShow (now branded Gabbie Hanna), Liza Koshy and Thomas Sanders. There are also countless Vine Compilations-some named simply or others whose titles are reflective of the humour that these vines represent such as "vines that keep me from ending it all" and "vines that butter my eggroll". These show the canon of vines, the scope of which ranges from quick scripted jokes to small cuts of longer videos that have gone viral "most often in their vine form). In 10 years, the scope of humour will change as it already has in meme culture alone, but people may be confused as to why saying its Wednesday is met with deafening screeches, why people drop croissants all the time or why everyone inexplicably has a basketball game tomorrow.
